            <h2>Context Behind this Project</h2>

            <div>
                <p>This program was created as a part of the capstone project that I was assigned to do as a part of my placement with ExxonMobil with the techNL High School Tech Immersion Program. For our capstone project, we were assigned to implement artificial intelligence in an area of our lives that would benefit from its presence. This web-browser-based application is meant to optimize the day of the user by eliminating the need for users to partake in time-consuming repetitive tasks. The front-end development for the program was written in HTML and was styled using CSS. The client script was entirely done using the language JavaScript. Ollama was also installed onto the local server a 2B perimeter model of Google Gemma could be run on the machine. The files for Google Gemma were then installed onto the machine prior to the release of this application. This tool is meant to save time for people working in offices so they can do things that make a difference for their companies.</p><br>
